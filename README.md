This is my second random [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) learning project! This time focusing just on the mobile experience because the primary goal was to try some functionalities and not  emphasizing responsiveness.
Additionally, I'm exploring, for the first time, the use of Framer Motion.

## Features üí°

<div align="justify">

- **Toggle Menu:** Reveals a navigation bar with multi-page navigation, featuring active styling for enhanced user experience.

- **Image Carousels:**

    1-  Developed a carousel featuring navigation icons (next and back arrows) to allow users to manually navigate through the images

    2- Implemented an carousel that automatically transitions between images. Utilized the `useEffect` hook for image transitions.

- **Form Submission:**  Created a form that, upon submission, displays a modal featuring a personalized message with the user's name and email. Implemented form validation to ensure the modal appears only when all required fields are filled; otherwise, an alert prompts users to provide the necessary information.
